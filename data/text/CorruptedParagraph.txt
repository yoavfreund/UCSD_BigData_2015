Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask
is the first man up. Consider! Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask,
have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I
wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I
used to when I was before the mast.For hereby Flask's dinner was badly
jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb
even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small
appetite, and soon more or less. For what he ate did not so much
relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and
satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I
am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned
beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the
mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of
glory: there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any
mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's
official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
awful Ahab.
